# pnt

Barebones structure for implementing a CAT naming test using shiny.

To run, make sure these packages are installed on your local machine:

``` r
# not run
install.packages(c("here", "shiny", "tibble", "dplyr", "tidyr", "shinyWidgets", "keys", "DT", "shinyjs", "catR"))
```

Then run the following:

``` r
# not run
shiny::runGitHub("rbcavanaugh/pnt")
```

Or clone the repository and run locally.

Note….you can just click on results after running a few of the test (not
practice) items so you don’t have to run through all the items…
