Barebones structure for implementing a naming test using shiny. To be
adapted for CAT/IRT

To run, make sure these packages are installed on your local machine:

``` r
# not run
install.packages(c("shiny", "tibble", "dplyr", "shinyWidgets", "keys", "DT"))
```

The run the following:

``` r
# not run
shiny::runGitHub("rbcavanaugh/pnt")
```

Or clone the repository and run locally.

Note….you can just click on results after running a few of the test (not
practice) items so you don’t have to run through all the items…
