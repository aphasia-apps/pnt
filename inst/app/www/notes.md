*Notes*

1. Re-administrations are limited based on the first test administered:
    - If the 30-item PNT-CAT is administered first, the 30-item PNT-CAT or variable-length PNT-CAT can be administered second.
    - If one of the two 30-item static short forms (Walker & Schwartz, 2012) are administered first, the other can be administered second.
    - If either 175-item tests are administered first, we do not recommend excluding items on the second   
    
2. The item 'eskimo' is excluded from all PNT-CAT administrations and excluded by default for the standard PNT administrations, although there is an option to include it for the full PNT. <a href="https://leader.pubs.asha.org/do/10.1044/leader.AE.26052021.26/full/" target="_blank">See here</a>
