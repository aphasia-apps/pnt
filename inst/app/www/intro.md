**THIS IS JUST A ROUGH DRAFT OF WHAT MIGHT GO HERE**

The PNT.CAT shiny application provides a simple user interface that provides
various options for delivering the Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT; Roach
et al., 1996) in an item response theory framework (IRT). The PNT is a 175-item
confrontation naming test utilized for assessing anomia severity from
individuals with aphasia developed at the [Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute.](https://mrri.org) The IRT parameters of this model were estimated
with an archival picture naming tests set of people with aphasia, including the MAPPD database  (Mirman et al., 2010) and scores from Fergadiotis (DATE). 

This application permits administration of the computer-adaptive PNT using a 30-, 60-, and 100- fixed-length and variable length administration based on precision of the naming ability estimate. It also includes options for administering the full PNT in order (Roach et al., 1996), and in random order as well as two 30-item PNT short forms as published by Walker et al., (2012). In cases where the PNT is either adminstered or scored offline, results can be uploaded to obtain IRT-based ability estimates. At the end of the test, users have the option of downloading performance data and a pdf-report of the results. 

Please note, that the intended population for this assessment are individuals with acquired language impairments and the testing instrument may be unreliable for other populations. Currently, the CAT-IRT PNT research has been validated for estimating naming ability, but does not yet include error-based estimates of semantic or phonological deficits. Furthermore, the app does not save any data beyond a single user session. If a break is needed, users should download their existing scored data. To minimize server costs, the app will time-out after 15 minutes of non-use and all data will be deleted.
