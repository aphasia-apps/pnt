1. Administer a new PNT:
  - The 30-item PNT-CAT is the recommended administration option for new PNT administrations. It also permits evaluation of change using another 30-item PNT-CAT or variable-length PNT-CAT.
  - The 175-item PNT-CAT allows users to administer ***up to*** the full 175 PNT in a computer-adaptive order. This option may be desirable for users who would like to administer more than 30 items to get a more precise estimate of naming ability or a better sense of error profiles. However, second administrations of the 175-item PNT-CAT are not yet available. The 175-item PNT-CAT can be stopped anytime and estimates will be reliable after 30 items have been administered.
  - The 175-item standard PNT allows the administration of the standard PNT as described in Roach et al., (1996).
2. Re-administer a PNT-CAT to assess change in naming ability
  - The second PNT-CAT can either be another 30-item PNT-CAT or a *variable-length* PNT-CAT (recommended)
  - The variable-length PNT-CAT will administer items until the uncertainty around the naming ability estimate (the Standard Error of the Mean) falls below the uncertainty in the first 30-item PNT-CAT. It typically administers 25-35 items, depending on an individuals performance. 
3. Estimate naming ability by uploading scores from an offline PNT. 
  - If you prefer to administer the PNT offline (materials available at https://mrri.org/philadelphia-naming-test/), it is possible to upload a spreadsheet of scored items to get an estimate of naming ability. 
  - A blank spreadsheet in the correct format is available on the next page, with instructions for entering responses. 
  - This option may also be used to get a revised ability estimate after administering the 30- or 175-item PNT-CAT if responses are corrected after administering the test.
  
  While the 175-item PNT-CAT permits users to administer up to the full PNT,* doing so is likely unnecessary to obtain a reliable estimate of naming ability as  additional items provide diminishing returns on the reliability of naming estimates <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6808378/" target="_blank">(Fergadiotis et al., 2019)</a>. However, clinicians may prefer to administer more than 30 items to improve their clinical impression of naming ability and error profiles.
