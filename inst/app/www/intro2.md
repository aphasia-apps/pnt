Two additional testing instruments are available. The **Variable length PNT-CAT (PNT-CATVL)** can be utilized to assess naming ability after a version of the PNT-CAT has been given, but will exclude overlapping items. Using the PNT-CATVL [Hula and colleagues (2019)]((https://pubs.asha.org/doi/full/10.1044/2019_JSLHR-L-19-0213)). Hula and his colleagues demonstrated naming ability estimates from 25 persons with aphasia estimated with the PNT-CAT30 and then again with a non-overlapping PNT-CATVL were highly correlated (r = 0.89). These results suggest that the PNT0CATVL may be utilized to assess the severity of anomia of people with aphasia with an alternate subset of items not delivered in the PNT-CAT30.  At the administred assessment, users have the option of downloading performance data and a pdf-report of the results.


In order to exclude items delivered from the PNT-CAT30 or PNT-CAT60 in the PNT-CATVL you must provide the application with a .csv file generated from the initial test administration. To complete this step, upload this file on the following page. Then, select the Variable length PNT-CAT option. At the end of the test, users have the option of downloading performance data and a pdf-report of the results.

In the cases where the PNT was either adminstered or scored offline, results can be uploaded to obtain IRT-based ability estimates. This application provides a simple user interface to estimate these parameters. Simply click the *score-offline test* button below. Users should also use this option to rescore assessments where responses were coded erroneously be the examiner. 

Please note, that the intended population for this assessment are individuals with acquired language impairments and the testing instrument may be unreliable for other populations.The app does not save any data beyond a single user session. 

To minimize server costs, the app will time-out after 15 minutes of non-use and all data will be deleted.
