**This is a list of things we want to convey on the instructions page**

- Click Start Practice to get started
- There will be 10 practice items to start
- Tell the participant "[Insert verbatim PNT instructions here]"
- Press 1 for incorrect and 2 for correct
- A 1 or 2 will appear in the top-right of the screen to show the key entered.
- Remember to score the first complete response
- Also of note, while the standard PNT administration rules allow examinees up to 30 seconds to respond to each item, consistent with Walker and Schwartz (2012), the validation studies for the present PNT-CAT short forms (Fergadiotis et al., 2019; Hula et al., 2020) allowed only 10 seconds.
- Press Enter to advance to the next item
- You can download results after the first (non-practice) item has been scored in case you want to end the test early. 
- Press the escape key to end the test at anytime
- Take your time making sure that the score you entered is correct before pressing enter.
- While you cannot go back to a previous item, you can download the results at the end of the test, fix the item scored incorrectly, and re-upload the file under the offline testing function to re-estimate the score. 
- If you are using the web/browser-based version of the app, it will time-out after 10 minutes of non-use. If you need to take a break, we recommend downloading the results. When you are ready to continue, you will need to re-enter the accuracy for the completed items. (We are working on a feature that would allow you to continue the test based on an uploaded file)
