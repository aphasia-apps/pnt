- On the next page, read the directions to the subject, and go through the practice items. 
- It is important to refrain from providing any verbal or nonverbal cues prior to the patientʼs response (including “What is this?).
- Allow up to 10 seconds for a response for computer adaptive tests and up to 30 seconds for static forms (see note below).
- Press 1 for an incorrect response. Press 2 for a correct response. Remember to only score the first complete response. 
- A 1 or 2 will appear in the top-right of the screen to show the key entered. This selection can be changed until pressing enter. 
- After entering a response, press the enter key or space bar to advance to the next item.
- Press the escape key to end the test (you will be asked to confirm ending the test). If confirmed, the app will go to the results page. 

**Notes:**

- While the standard PNT administration rules allow examinees up to 30 seconds to respond to each item, consistent with Walker and Schwartz (2012), the validation studies for the present PNT-CAT short forms (Fergadiotis et al., 2019; Hula et al., 2020) allowed only 10 seconds.
- You can download results after the first (non-practice) item has been scored in case you want to end the test early. 
- Take your time making sure that the score you entered is correct before pressing enter. While you cannot go back to a previous item, you can download the results at the end of the test, revise the scoring for any items, and re-upload the file under the offline testing function to re-estimate the score. 
- If you are using the web/browser-based version of the app, it will time-out after 10 minutes of non-use. If you need to take a break, we recommend downloading the results. When you are ready to continue, you will need to re-enter the accuracy for the completed items. (We are working on a feature that would allow you to continue the test based on an uploaded file)
- Examiners may wish to audio record testing sessions to preserve responses for later review, as was recommended in the standard PNT instructions. 
- The standard PNT instructions suggest giving the examinee feedback after a response, but this may not be desirable if repeat administrations are anticipated
- For the Standard PNT, examinees were allowed a break between items #88 (tractor”) and #89 (queen) if necessary, as a brief rest period or as a stop location if the examiner feels that the test would be best administered over 2 sessions. If running the app locally, the app can be left running. However, if administering the test using the free online version, it is best to download data and use the "continue test" function on the previous page. The data can be downloaded after pressing the escape key.  See <a href="https://aphasia-apps.github.io/pnt/articles/articles/pnt.html" target="_blank">the application website</a> for instructions on running the app locally.
