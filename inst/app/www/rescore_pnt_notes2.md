Option 2: Modify a results file from a previous test.
- Only modify the key column
- Enter 1 for error/incorrect and 2 for correct in the key column
- Leave any items not completed as 'NA'
- Take care not to change other aspects of the spreadsheet (such as column names or item names)
- Save the modified file as a .csv file
- Upload the file to the left.
