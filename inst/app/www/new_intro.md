This application allows clinician users to administer adaptive (PNT-CAT) and static versions of the Philadelphia Naming Test (<a href="http://aphasiology.pitt.edu/215/1/24-09.pdf)" target="_blank">Roach et al., 1996</a> and generate output that provides scores on a common T-score metric, where the expected mean and standard deviation of persons with aphasia are 50 and 10, respectively. 

Users of this application should first familiarize themselves with the <a href="https://mrri.org/philadelphia-naming-test/" target="_blank">administration and scoring procedures for the PNT</a>, with a focus on the rules for determining the first complete attempt and for identifying correct responses. The application uses only dichotomous correct/incorrect scoring, which can be applied online with sufficient accuracy by trained users. However, because the rules for determining the first complete attempt, and, to a lesser extent, correct responses can be challenging to apply in some cases, we recommend audio recording administrations for offline review. 

Users should also review the <a href="https://aphasia-apps.github.io/pnt/articles/articles/PNT-Versions.html" target="_blank">different versions of the PNT available and their psychometric properties.</a>. 

For users looking for a deeper dive into principles of item-response theory and computer adaptive testing in aphasia, we recommend:
