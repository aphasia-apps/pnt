This web-app implements the computer adaptive version of the Philadelphia Naming Test ([Roach et al., 1996](http://aphasiology.pitt.edu/215/1/24-09.pdf)) for clinical use. The 30-item computer adaptive Philadelphia Naming Test (PNT-CAT) can estimate the naming ability of people with aphasia with high reliability to the full 175-item PNT ([Fergadiotis, Hula, Swiderski, Lei, and Kellough, 2018](https://pubs.asha.org/doi/full/10.1044/2018_JSLHR-L-18-0344)). Rather than delivering all 175 items in order, The PNT-CAT chooses the next item based on how well an individual names previous items. Computer adaptive testing is based on item-response theory; see [Fergadiotis, Casilio, Hula, and Swiderski, 2021](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0041-1727252) and https://aswiderski.shinyapps.io/IRTapp/ for a primer on item-response theory and naming in aphasia.

This web-app allows Speech-Language Pathologists to:

1. Administer a 30-item PNT-CAT, 175-item PNT-CAT, 175-item Standard PNT. 
2. Re-administer a 30-item PNT-CAT or variable-length PNT-CAT to assess change in naming ability
3. Upload a scores from an offline PNT to get an ability estimate. 

For each option, users have the option of downloading performance data and a pdf-report of the results.

The code is open source and can be accessed on [Github](https://github.com/aphasia-apps/pnt). The web-app can also be installed locally and used without an internet connection. Refer to the github.com page for instructions for installation. Feedback and pull requests are welcome and encouraged. Please note that the app does not store any data beyond a single user-session. 

Research supporting this application has been funded by the National Institutes of Health - National Institute for Deafness and other Communication Disorders (NIH-NIDCD) awarded to William Hula and Gerasimos Fergadiotis. The app was built and designed by Rob Cavanaugh, Alex Swiderski, Gerasimos Fergadiotis, and William Hula.
